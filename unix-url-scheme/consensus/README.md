# unix uri uri scheme consensus

This section is for officially documenting a consensus on the use of the unix uri scheme.

The procedures for listing on [IANA uri schemes]( https://www.iana.org/assignments/uri-schemes/uri-schemes.xhtml) is documented in [RFC7595](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7595).

In order to be listed as permanent a standards track proposal has to be accepted. The `template.txt` is a copy of **RFC6694 - the about uri scheme** as a reference example.

It is not clear whether these protocols would even be onsidered by ietf as their internet applicability may be debateable. If ietf is not
appropriate we should establish an alternative means to establish the same acceptance. Looking for more suggestions and ideas please start
an issue this topic.
